After a week and a few days of struggles I decided to switch to Game Center for my Leaderboard and Achievementsâ€¦ I have a backed up version that still has Google Play Games on it and will continue to work with it but for the sake of turning something in that works I am using Game Center now. I have implemented 9 Achievements, fixed the share button and set up a proper leaderboard. I intend to add more achievements before I release the product but I have finished the achievements needed for this class.
