In the GameScene.swift file you will see added sprites and audio nodes for the addition of orbs as well as variables to handle the level, coin counts, orb count, and if an orb has been acquired. I added a level label and orb label to the createScene function as well as two sounds for the orbs and a sound for defusing the bomb. I added two functions for creating the orbs and added function for the menu button. I adjust my dropBomb function to allow for the duration of the bombs dropping to increase as the player made it further into the game. I adjust the TouchesBegan function to hand the touching of the menu button. This is where I also added the logic for the increase in levels using a switch statement. In the didBeginContact function I adjusted the physics handling for orbs touching the ground, added an if statement to determine if orbs have been collected and handled if the bird touched a bomb with the orb on and with the orb off it also determines if your orbCount has gone to zero and turns of the defusing of bombs when the orbCount reaches 0. I added coin counts to the coin physics to determine when to drop the red orb and the green orb and when the count hits 10 it drops the redOrb and when it hits 25 it drops the greenOrb. Lastly I added Physics for the orbs when they come into contact with the bird. It turns on the orb to defuse bombs and adds the correct count to the orb count. The red orb adds one defuse and the green orb adds 3 defuse. I changed the logic for the greenOrb due to the fact that 5 defuse for the green orb made the game play a little too easy for my liking.
